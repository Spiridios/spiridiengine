TODO:

Need some way for Actors and Behaviors to access information about the screen.
Need some way for user defined behaviors to access game state specific logic.
Since all Behaviors require an actor reference, should there be some standard way for an actor to attach itself?
Behavior.Actor should be renamed, since it clashes with the class Actor.
